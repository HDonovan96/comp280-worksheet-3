\section{Introduction}

My original idea was to make improvements by setting up the level loading to happen asynchronously, as well as to implement object pooling. I discovered, however, that Photon (PUN2), the package we are using to handle our networking, does this automatically. As such, this is my burner choice. Hi! Have a good day, at least that's one you don't have to read.
